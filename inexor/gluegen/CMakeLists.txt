## This is the CMake file for the gluegen standalone tool.
##
## Its used for generating reflection boilerplate code and hence gets
## shipped precompiled as tool which is integrated in the build-process on every platform.
## It does need Doxygen for parsing the source and providing us with an AST (which inform us about Shared Declarations).
